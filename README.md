# Ozzie Pardilla Week 5 Final Project June 25th, 2017 MSTU 5003 Professor Jin Kuwata
This is my Week 5 Final Project README.MD

This project is a 3 page website that features two quizzes. The quizzes are designed to return feedback to the
end user in various forms from the main.js
While the quiz itself is hard-coded in the math and Geo pages, the site has features that are not available until the user interacts.
In the nav bar section, the Quiz World logo features an Onmouse and Onclick event that toggles the font color white and gold.
On the home page there is a section where a user inputs their name and the script returns a greeting with their name and instructions to select a quiz from the buttons.
During either the Math quiz or the Geo quiz, the user receives a "countdown" of items left as well as messages if the submit button is pressed before all questions are answered.
Lastly, once the quizzes are taken, the user is given a final tally of the results.
